  This forecasting algorithm uses the Prophet algorithm released by Meta.
  Unfortunately, this algorithm does not provide any means to calculate a
  Coefficient of determination, therefore this data will not be available.

parameters:
  size:
    description: >-
      The amount of years that shall be predicted, after the source data is
      available.
    default: 30
    type: int
  interval_width:
    description: >-
      This value determines the width of the uncertainty intervals around the
      forecasted data.
    default: 0.8
    type: float
  changepoint_prior_scale:
    description: >-
      This parameter describes the strength of the sparse prior. Increasing this
      value from its default value will make the trend more flexible
    default: 0.05
    type: float
  changepoint_range:
    description: >-
      This parameter describes the percentage of time series in which
      changepoints are inferred
    default: 0.8
    type: float
    min: 0
    max: 100
  groupBy:
    description: >-
      The column the data should be grouped by before running the calculation
    default: 'municipal'
    type: str
    enums:
      - 'municipal'
      - 'usageType'
