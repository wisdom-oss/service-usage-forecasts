  This forecasting algorithm uses the Prophet algorithm released by Meta.
  Unfortunately, this algorithm does not provide any means to calculate a
  Coefficient of determination, therefore this data will not be available.

parameters:
  size:
    description: >-
      The amount of years that shall be predicted, after the source data is
      available.
    default: 30
    type: float
  interval_width:
    description: >-
      This value determines the width of the uncertainty intervals around the
      forecasted data.
    default: 0.8
    type: float
  mcmc_samples:
    description: >-
      This value enables a full Bayesian sampling needed to retrieve 
      uncertainties in the seasonality. However, enabling this will make the
      calculation and fitting much longer, depending on the input data set
    default: 0
    type: float
  changepoint_prior_scale:
    description: >-
      Large values will allow many 
      changepoints, small values will allow few changepoints
    default: 0.05
    type: float
